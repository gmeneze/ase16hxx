2. *Keywords*
  1. **Bug Reports**:Any technical issue that occurs in a software application is described in a bug report by the users encountering the bug. The bug reports are stored in an issue database. There can be multiple bug reports for the same technical issue which leads to duplicate bug reports. The aim of the paper is to identify such duplicate reports.
  2. **Automated Detection**:Whenever a new bug report is issued it should be automatically detected as a duplicate report without any manual intervention.
  3. **Information Retrevial**: This is the duplicate bug detection approach introduced in this paper. The DBTM approach leverages 2 features namely the text based information retrieval and topic based features to identify the duplicate bug reports describing the similar technical issue/s. 
  4. **Genetic Algorithm**: This is the topic model used by the authors of this paper. It is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) which represents the topic (technical issues) structure of the bug report and also describes the duplication relations among the bug reports. 
  5. **BM25F**: This technique is used by the authors to measure textual similarity among the bug reports. BM25F measures the global (shared technical issue) importance and local (technical issue constrained to that bug report) importance of every word that appears in the bug report. 

3. *Notes (4 of 19)*
  1. **Motivational Statements**: Bug detection and bug fixing is one of the most important tasks in producing a high quality software product. Bugs are encountered by users working with the software application and the detected bugs are reported by the users via bug reports. Since, there are multiple users using the application, same bugs can be encountered by multiple users and multiple bug reports describing the same issue can be present in the database. Detecting these duplicate bug reports is extremely important as it can reduce maintenance effort (if the bug is already fixed) and provide more information about resolving the issue (if the bug is not yet fixed).
  2. **Related Work**: There are various techniques being developed to detect duplicate bug reports using machine learning and natural language processing. One of the most successful techniques in detecting duplicate reports is REP. It is an advanced Information Retrieval (IR) technique that relies on high textual similarity among duplicate bug reports. Since, bug reports are compiled by different users who have different ways of expressing the issue, it is possible that duplicate reports may not have textual similarity. These reports cannot be detected as duplicate by the REP technique. The DBTM methodology described in this paper can detect duplicity among textually dissimilar reports by leveraging IR based and topic based features. 
  3. **Study Instruments**: The authors had various bug reports to test their algorithm on. The authors evaluated the performance of the DBTM algorithm on the bug reports generated by Eclipse, Open Office and Mozilla users.
  4. **Baseline Results**: The performance of the DBTM algorithm is compared against that of standard algorithms like REP and RTM with respect to accuracy on Eclipse, Open Office and Mozilla bug reports. In each of the case the DBTM model outperformed the state-of-art REP and RTM models. On average DBTM performed 10-13% better than the REP detection technique and 4-7% better than the RTM technique. 

4. *Needs improvement*
  1. Popular bug reporting platforms like JIRA and Bugzilla allow reporters to attach screenshots. Many times bug reporters use this facility to attach screenshots containing all information pertaining to a bug. Pure textual analysis of bug summary and bug comments will not be useful in such cases, extraction of text from images might be useful. 
  2. The tool has been tested only on three projects and the results are not very conclusive, only for Eclipse the accuracy was found to be more than 50%. It would be useful to include more projects, especially popular ones, like Apache projects.
  3. Popular bug reporting platforms like JIRA and Bugzilla provide the reporter with fields to tag bugs to different topics, versions of the app etc. This information can be used to classify bugs and in some cases textual analysis may not be needed at all because the bug has already been tagged properly. The authors could get better performance using this knowledge.
